What is WordPress Stats Widget?
-------------------------------

It's an Android app widget that allows users to keep constant track of the number of views in blogs that use [WordPress.com Stats plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/). It shows the views in a beautiful chart--only bar chart at the moment but more types are coming soon.
